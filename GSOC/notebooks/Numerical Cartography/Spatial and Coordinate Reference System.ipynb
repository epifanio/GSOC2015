    "# Spatial and Coordinate Reference System\n",
    "\n",
    "A **spatial reference system** (SRS) or **coordinate reference system** (CRS) is a [coordinate-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system) local, regional or global system used to locate geographical entities. A spatial reference system defines a specific [map projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection), as well as transformations between different spatial reference systems. Spatial reference systems are defined by the [OGC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium)'s [Simple feature access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_feature_access) using [well-known text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text), and support has been implemented by several [standards-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard) [geographic information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system). Spatial reference systems can be referred to using a [SRID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRID) integer, including EPSG codes defined by the [International Association of Oil and Gas Producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Oil_and_Gas_Producers).\n",

    "    \n",
    "   In order to be unambiguous about the direction of \"vertical\" and the \"surface\" above which they are measuring, map-makers choose a reference ellipsoid with a given origin and orientation that best fits their need for the area they are mapping. They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference systemor geodetic datum. Datums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole earth, or they may be local, meaning that they represent a best-fit ellipsoid to only a portion of the earth.\n",

    "   * The mean sea level as described by the gravity geoid, yielding the orthometric height\n",
    "   * A vertical datum, yielding a dynamic height relative to a known reference height.\n",
    "Along with the latitude $\\phi$ and longitude $\\lambda$, the height $h$ provides the three-dimensional *geodetic coordinates* or *geographic coordinates* for a location."
